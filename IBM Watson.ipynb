My worker went to A& E at Ng Teng Feng for a hand injury and after doing swab test and tested negative he was supposed to be discharged. However he was told to stay in the hospital until MOH cleared him. Do take note at this point of time he was cleared of Covid19.  The next morning instead of discharging him he was sent to a hotel swab isolation facility when the discharge papers clearly said he was cleared to return back to residence.  As my due duty i called in to the hospital which pushed the issue to MOH and MOH in turn told me to look for the Hotel operator who in turn told me to look for Cisco.  After calling all of these MOH said they couldn't tell me why he was sent there and they will forward the case to the relevant department.  My question at this point is why is there no paper to indicate why worker was sent there and for how long.  \",\n",

Most of them are seen wearing very old used surgical masks... I have myself many a times offered them new masks packet.. but its shame when i see well to do families wearing masks so wrong...  Loads of hard work has been put to control the spread, many sacrifices by people done... And now the restlessness of people to return to normal is quite expected however one haste and all good work will go in drain....   With so much relaxation already people have shown their complacent nature... Once the rules is fully removed... And people are fully careless.. we may be back to where we start...  But at cost of what... Be aware that many may loose thier gifted life just because someone took his mild symptoms too light... And ended up infecting many...  Nobody yet knows how many in society are asymptomatic and / or hiding as symptoms very mild or they may not even know that they are covid-19 infected.. and are doing age old home remedies...  I do not want to stay scared however showing haste to get rid of all rules and restrictions and back to normal life with no vaccine or medicine, to me seems not very intelligent....
